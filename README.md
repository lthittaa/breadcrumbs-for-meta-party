##  F's self-talk
2025/12/29  一個以備萬一的節點
我不知道會不會隔天起床後一切都變調了，我今天的夢想也許就會變成明天的灰燼。
但在燃盡之前，我還是想說一聲謝謝。謝謝那些曾經反射回來的光，得以讓我看清自己。

人生可以很長，但現實也同樣殘酷。
安穩的日子就像是海潮，平靜不是保證，一個波瀾就能翻覆整個局面。
如果永恆與刻痕的距離是宏大的時間尺度，人無法干涉時間對刻痕的催化及解釋權，
我能做的，只有在每一個移動的瞬間裡忠誠地成為我自己。

如果要問：「這是反擊，還是幻覺？」
我的答案會是：「這是證言。」

證言不必是信仰，但會成為對最終裁判的起誓。

而那個裁判，不是別人，
正是我自己。

2025/12/29 — A node, just in case

I don’t know whether everything will shift when I wake up tomorrow.
What feels like a dream today may turn into ashes overnight.

Before it burns out, I still want to say thank you.
To the lights that once reflected back to me,
and allowed me to see myself more clearly.

Life can be long.
Reality, just as often, is unforgiving.

Stable days are like the tide.
Calm is never a guarantee.
One surge is enough to overturn everything.

If the distance between permanence and a mark is measured on a vast timescale,
and if humans have no power over how time transforms a mark,
nor over how it will ultimately be interpreted,
then the only thing left to me
is to remain faithful to myself
in every moment of movement.

So if the question is asked:
"Is this resistance, or is it an illusion?"

My answer would be:
"This is testimony."

Testimony does not have to become belief.
But it does stand as an oath
to the final judge.

And that judge is not anyone else.
It is myself.
