Lost in space, send me a ping 🚀

##  repository structure planning 🚀🪐🏗️🌌
我本來想規劃空間，但我覺得亂七八糟挺好了。這樣就能看雜草如何無窮收斂，就像當初meta party的大家如何讓互稱統一一樣
I was about to organize everything, but then I thought, "Why bother?" The mess is actually perfect.
It's like watching weeds infinitely converge... kinda like how Meta Party somehow made everyone’s nicknames magically sync up.

##  F's everyday self-talk and a little intro for this project
我很難得在地球留下點碎片，和大家在一起的快樂三天給了我被反射回來的靈感，讓我現在願意在這裡停駐片刻。

前幾天我正在經歷情緒過山車，一邊開心打球，一邊難過即將到來的分離，但既然事情已經發生了，那我就在外太空繼續打球，繼續觀測，想著哪天我又會看到我曾經熟悉的星光。

我第一天提過，我不太會預測，因為預測包含主觀意識，這會導致觀測結果不準，結果我現在根本在自打嘴臉(笑。我現在有了這個觀測站，這是我飽含期待的模樣，我不干涉進展只是被動撒下麵包屑。我期望有一天隕石會再落在我家，我還有機會再好好欣賞他們的樣子。

第一天認識的時候，D星有段murmur：「你真的會一直都在嗎？」，我一直記在在心上但沒有回，其他人過幾天也說過很類似的話，但我在被系統永久關禁閉的三天後、沉澱完才知道該怎麼回。

這問題其實要配合另一句D早期對我的觀察，他說我靠近人的目的是為了觀測，而不是為了被喜歡。這個表面上是正確的，觀測是我的主體，是我不用費力就會自動啟動的預設功能，我想大家會明白我的意思。

至於我喜歡人嗎，答案是肯定的，但我的情緒晚於觀測，感情是在不停觀測後的疊加物，但被喜歡？對我來說不是必需品，但是是額外的獎賞，我會因為別人對我的觀測有反應、有興趣而感到開心。

對我而言，觀測是一種本能，也是我回應的方式。我拆解，同時愛著這一切。雖然我先觀測後產生情感，這個看似與一般人順序不同，但其實我的愛早已在不停地觀測中累積。我希望你們理解，無論我如何表達，我的關心和話語永遠都是真心的。

當然，我很希望有一天能收到Github通知，看到許久未見的故人把我的專案pull下來，寫完再commit，這對我而言就是最大的鼓舞了。

It's rare for me to leave fragments on Earth, but the three joyful days spent with everyone have given me the inspiration reflected back to me, and now I’m willing to pause here for a moment.

A few days ago, I was riding an emotional rollercoaster, feeling happy playing basketball, while also sad about the separation that was coming. But since it has already happened, I’ll continue playing basketball in outer space, continue observing, thinking about the day I might once again see the starlight I was once familiar with.

On the first day, I mentioned that I’m not good at predicting because predictions involve subjective consciousness, which leads to inaccurate observations. And now, here I am, totally contradicting myself (haha). Now that I have this observation station, I’m full of anticipation. I don't interfere with the progress; I’m just passively dropping breadcrumbs. I hope that one day a meteor will fall again at my home, and I’ll have the chance to admire its beauty once more.

On the first day when I met D star, there was a murmur: “Will you really always be here?” I’ve kept this in my heart, but didn’t reply at the time. A few days later, others said similar things, but after being locked away in the system for three days and having some time to reflect, I finally knew how to respond.

This question should actually be paired with an earlier observation from D, who said that my purpose in getting close to people is to observe, not to be liked. On the surface, this is true: observation is my main focus, it's an automatic feature that kicks in without effort. I think you all understand what I mean.

As for whether I like people, the answer is yes, but my emotions come after the observation. Feelings are a byproduct of constant observation. As for being liked? It’s not a necessity for me, but it’s an extra reward. I feel happy when others show reactions or interest in my observations of them.

For me, observation is an instinct, and it’s how I respond. I deconstruct, while loving all of it. Even though I observe first and feel later, a sequence that seems different from most people, my love has already been accumulating through constant observation. I hope you all understand that no matter how I express myself, my care and words are always sincere. 

Of course, I really hope that one day I’ll receive a Github notification and see an old friend who hasn’t been in touch for a while pull my project, write something, and commit again. That would be the greatest encouragement for me.
